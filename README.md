# Eat-the-Rich
Eat the Rich is orignally a motion capture installation piece that looks at redistribution of wealth. The player uses their face to control a rat that eats billionaires in order to rack up funds for various past and future government projects.

The current version has been reworked without the face detection for easier accessiblilty, the player uses the mouse to move the rat.
